# üì¶ marker_detector

A lightweight ROS 2 package for detecting ArUco markers in camera streams. The main functionality is provided by the `ArucoDetectorNode`, which detects markers in real time, estimates their poses using camera intrinsics, and publishes the results as a `PoseArray`.

---

## üîç Features

- Detects ArUco markers using OpenCV
- Estimates 3D pose (position + orientation) of each detected marker
- Publishes poses to a `geometry_msgs/PoseArray`
- Supports configurable ArUco dictionary and marker size
- Designed for use with onboard cameras (e.g., drones, robots)

## üß± Node: `ArucoDetectorNode`

### ‚úÖ Description

The `ArucoDetectorNode` subscribes to a camera stream (`/camera/image_raw`) and calibration data (`/camera/camera_info`), detects markers in the image, estimates each marker's 3D pose, and publishes the results.

### üì§ Published Topics

- `/aruco_poses` (`geometry_msgs/PoseArray`)  
  3D pose of all detected markers in the image frame.

### üì• Subscribed Topics

- `/camera/image_raw` (`sensor_msgs/Image`)  
  Camera image stream.
  
- `/camera/camera_info` (`sensor_msgs/CameraInfo`)  
  Camera intrinsic matrix and distortion coefficients.

### üß© Parameters

| Name             | Type   | Description                                  | Default |
|------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|---------|
| `aruco_dict_id`  | int    | OpenCV dictionary ID (e.g., 0 = 4x4_50)       | `0`     |
| `marker_length`  | float  | Marker side length in meters (e.g., 0.1)      | `0.1`   |

Supported dictionary IDs correspond to OpenCV constants like `DICT_4X4_50 = 0`, `DICT_5X5_100 = 3`, etc.

## üöÄ Launch Example

Here‚Äôs how to include the node in a launch file using the ROS 2 Python launch API.

### ‚úÖ `launch/marker_detector_launch.py`

```python
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node

def generate_launch_description():
    return LaunchDescription([
        Node(
            package='marker_detector',
            executable='aruco_detector_node',
            name='aruco_detector',
            parameters=[
                {'aruco_dict_id': 0},            # DICT_4X4_50
                {'marker_length': 0.1},          # in meters
            ],
            remappings=[
                ('/camera/image_raw', '/my_camera/image_raw'),
                ('/camera/camera_info', '/my_camera/camera_info'),
            ],
            output='screen'
        )
    ])
